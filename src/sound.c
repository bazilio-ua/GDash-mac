/*
    The C64 sound chip (the SID) had 3 channels. Boulder Dash used all 3 of them.
    
    Different channels were used for different sounds.
    Channel 1: other small sounds, ie. diamonds falling, boulders rolling.

    Channel 2: Walking, diamond collecting and explosion; also time running out sound.

    Channel 3: amoeba sound, magic wall sound,
        cave cover & uncover sound, and the crack sound (gate open)
    
    Sounds have precedence over each other. Ie. the crack sound is given precedence
    over other sounds (amoeba, for example.)
    Different channels also behave differently. Channel 2 sounds are not stopped, ie.
    walking can not be heard, until the explosion sound is finished playing completely.
    Explosions are always restarted, though. This is controlled by the array defined
    in cave.c.
    Channel 1 sounds are always stopped, if a new sound is requested.
    
    Here we implement this a bit differently. We use samples, instead of synthesizing
    the sounds. By stopping samples, sometimes small clicks generate. Therefore we do
    not stop them, rather fade them out quickly. (The SID had filters, which stopped
    these small clicks.)
    Also, channel 1 and 2 should be stopped very often. So I decided to use two
    SDL_Mixer channels to emulate one C64 channel; and they are used alternating.
    SDL channel 4 is the "backup" channel 1, channel 5 is the backup channel 2.
    Other channels have the same indexes.
